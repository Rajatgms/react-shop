We used Redux and React-Redux to do state management of React Shop Application.

- We used Redux HOC approach - mapStateToProps and mapDispatchToProp.


Pros - 
1. Centralized state management.
2. No prop-drilling.
3. No unnecessary component re-render.

Cons - 
1. Need to configure redux.
2. Manage Redux - action, reducer and container.
3. Difficult to avoid some component re-rendering with Redux HOC approach.
