We used React state to do state management of React Shop Application.

Pros -

1. No need to install and configure external state management library.
2. No state management library learning curve.

Cons -

1. No centralize state of the application.
2. Prop drilling.
3. Difficult to avoid component re-rendering if state change at composite component.
4. Refactoring and scaling application will be time-consuming.
5. Debugging application will need more efforts.
